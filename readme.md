Overview

This project leverages real-time hand tracking to transform your palm and fingers into an augmented reality (AR) user interface. By detecting hand landmarks, the system visualizes palm data, finger rotations, and gestures, providing an interactive and futuristic UI experience.

Features

Real-time hand tracking with visualized landmarks.

Palm data monitoring (e.g., openness, orientation).

Finger rotation and gesture detection.

Futuristic AR UI overlay on your hand.

Lightweight and beginner-friendly.

Demo


Example showing palm tracking, rotation, and UI overlay.

Installation
